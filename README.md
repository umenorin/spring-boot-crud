# spring-boot-crud

### Project Objective:
  The project aims to create a CRUD application to enhance my skills with the Java language and its framework, Spring Boot.

### Technologies Used 
  The technologies employed in this project include Java 17, MariaDB, Spring Boot, and JPA.

### Functionalities
  The primary functionality of this project is to allow users to create, view, edit, and remove tasks, which are represented by the "Task" class created in this project.

### Architecture and Design 
  The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, consisting of only one class named "Task" and an enum called "Status."

### Next Steps
  My next step will be to develop a front-end using Angular to implement the CRUD operations.
